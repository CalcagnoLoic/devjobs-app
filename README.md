If you want to run the project locally, use docker and a code editor, having first cloned the project.

## Launching backend  `docker compose`

To connect to the database service, simply write these environment variables to a file named `.env`. This data is dummy data. During the development phase, these variables will no longer be available.

```
MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD=example
MARIADB_USER=admin@devjobs
MARIADB_PASSWORD=secretpw
MARIADB_DATABASE=devjobs
```

Then you can run this command:

```cmd
$ docker compose up
```

## Launching frontend with vite

```cmd
$ cd frontend
$ npm i
$ npm run dev
```
